### Single Language Storage:
When a customer submits in English:
```python
title_en = "Customer's Title"
content_en = "Customer's Content"
category_en = "Customer's Category"
title_pl = ""  # Empty - admin can fill later
content_pl = ""  # Empty
category_pl = ""  # Empty
is_customer_post = True
customer_language = "en"
```

When a customer submits in Polish:
```python
title_pl = "Tytuł klienta"
content_pl = "Treść klienta"
category_pl = "Kategoria klienta"
title_en = ""  # Empty - admin can fill later
content_en = ""  # Empty
category_en = ""  # Empty
is_customer_post = True
customer_language = "pl"
```

### Form Validation:
- Title: 5-200 characters (required)
- Content: Minimum 50 characters (required)
- Language: EN or PL (required)
- Category: Optional
- Author name: Optional
- Author email: Optional (validated if provided)

### Status Workflow:
```
Customer submits → pending
Admin approves → published (visible on site)

Admin edits → can change status to published/draft
```
