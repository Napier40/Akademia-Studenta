## Key Changes

- Click "Submit Your Post" button to reveal the form
- No separate page needed - everything happens on `/blog`

### 2. Single Language Submission
- Customers choose ONE language: English OR Polish
- No need to provide translations
- Admin can add translations later if needed

### 3. Form Fields
**Required:**
- Language selection (EN/PL)
- Title
- Content (minimum 50 characters)

**Optional:**
- Category

3. Admin sees post on dashboard with:
   - "Customer" badge

   - Customer name (if provided)
4. Admin can:
   - **Approve** - Publishes immediately

- If submitted in Polish:
  - `title_pl`, `content_pl`, `category_pl` = customer input
  - `title_en`, `content_en`, `category_en` = empty (admin can fill later)

### Status Values:
