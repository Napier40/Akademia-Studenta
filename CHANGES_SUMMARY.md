# Customer Blog Submission Redesign - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Changed

Your Flask blog application has been redesigned based on your requirements:

### ✅ Customer Blog Submission
- **BEFORE:** Separate page requiring bilingual submission (both English AND Polish)
- **AFTER:** Integrated form on blog page, single language submission (English OR Polish)

### ✅ Admin Dashboard Purpose
- **BEFORE:** Basic post management
- **AFTER:** Full moderation system to remove inappropriate posts and reply to customers

## 📋 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Blog Page Integration
- Customer submission form is now **directly on the `/blog` page**
- Click "Submit Your Post" button to reveal collapsible form
- No separate page navigation needed

### 2. Single Language Submission
- Customers choose **ONE language**: English OR Polish
- No translation required from customers
- Admin can add translations later if needed

### 3. Admin Moderation Workflow
- All customer posts go to **"pending" status**
- Admin dashboard shows:
  - "Customer" badge on submissions
  - Language indicator (EN/PL)
  - Customer name (if provided)
  - Submission date/time
- Admin can:
  - **Approve** → Publishes immediately
  - **Edit** → Modify before publishing
  - **Reject** → Removes inappropriate content

### 4. Customer Inquiry Replies
- Admin can now **reply directly** to customer inquiries
- Reply interface integrated into admin panel
- Track reply status and timestamps
