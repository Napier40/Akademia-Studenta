# Database Initialization Fix

## Problem
The application was throwing an error on startup:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: blog_posts
```

This occurred because the database tables weren't being created automatically when the application started.

## Solution
Added automatic table creation to `app.py`:

```python
# Create tables if they don't exist
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

This code is placed right after the Babel initialization and ensures that all database tables are created automatically when the application starts.

## How It Works
1. `with app.app_context():` - Creates an application context
2. `db.create_all()` - Creates all tables defined in the SQLAlchemy models if they don't already exist
3. This runs every time the application starts, but only creates missing tables (it won't overwrite existing data)

## What This Means for You
- **No need to run `init_db.py` manually** - Tables are created automatically
- **Safe to restart the application** - Existing data is preserved
- **Fresh installations work immediately** - No separate database setup step required

## If You Still Want Sample Data
If you want to add the 3 sample blog posts, you can still run:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

This will:
1. Create tables (if they don't exist)
2. Add sample bilingual blog posts (if they don't exist)

## Updated Startup Process
1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Navigate to flask-app: `cd flask-app`
3. Run the application: `python app.py` (or `run.bat` on Windows)
4. Access at: http://localhost:5000

That's it! The database is automatically initialized on first run.

## Technical Details
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` method
- Idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times)
- Creates tables based on model definitions in `app.py`
- Preserves existing data and tables
- No migration files needed for initial setup
